Hello world!

We're going to be building a code-generating instruction-following tool-calling metacognitive AI agent.

We're going to be approaching this project from the perspective of someone who has never once before in their life tried to write code.

We'll be basically creating and testing small bits of it at a time individually, connecting the pieces together, testing those pieces together, and following a process.

That process will kind of mimic evolution. It will lead us to increasing functional complexity that will/may enable the emergence of some more complex and interesting behaviors if we do it right.

This approach may be slower than many of you would like, but my aim is to empower people, prepare them for the future, and educate people as to what's really possible now.

What a time to be alive.
